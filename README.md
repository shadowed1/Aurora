## *Run apps in Borealis using emulated AUR helpers, Flatpak, Git, Python, and GCC for signficantly higher performance than Crostini!*

*With Steam support ending in 2026, a new project will be made for running Steam + apps with similar performance.* <br> <br>
*When this new program is ready, a link will be available.* <br>


### Requirements: 

- ChromeOS
- Steam installed and open (log in not required)
- Steam (Borealis) VM can be enabled in chrome://flags for x86 users if below hardware requirements.  
<br>

### How to install:

- Open Crosh (ctrl-alt-t) and type in: <br>
`vsh borealis`

- Copy Paste in borealis shell: <br>
<pre>bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadowed1/Aurora/main/aurora_installer.sh?$(date +%s)")</pre> <br>

*Aurora needs Borealis; it won't work anywhere else.*

<br>
<br>

### Features:

- Fantastic hardware acceleration for all apps; even unsupported web browsers.
- Steam can be closed entirely as long as an app is running.
- Borealis shell tabs automatically initiate Flatpak support.
- Tweak display scaling and cursor size. 
- Change default apps, generate shortcuts and icons, and download + extract tar files.
- Emulate pacman, yay, pacaur, and paru to download packages from arch repo directly. 
- Uninstaller is able to clean up after itself.

### How to use: 

<br>

Commands with examples: <br>

`aurora                  # Show current display and cursor values` <br>
`aurora display 1.0      # Set display scaling factor (0.25 - 4.0)` <br>
`aurora cursor 32        # Set cursor size (8 - 200)` <br>
`aurora help             # Show help` <br>
`aurora_debug            # echo a list of paths that flatpak will use` <br>
`aurora reinstall        # Redownload Aurora from Github` <br>
`aurora uninstall        # Launch uninstaller` <br>
`aurora shortcut         # Create desktop shortcuts` <br> <br>


`starman                # Open GUI app launcher` <br>
`starman refresh        # Update app list` <br>

`starman                    # Open quick access menu` <br> 
`starman default            # Menu to set default apps` <br>
`starman reset              # Remove app entries in quick access menu` <br> <br>
`pacman https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libvlc/` <br>
`pacman vlc` <br>

`flatpak list               # Show list of installed apps` <br>
`flatpak --help             # flatpak has a lot of commands!` <br>

`flatpak search Discord` <br>
`flatpak install com.discordapp.Discord` <br>
`flatpak run com.discordapp.Discord` <br>

Failed to connect to bus error it must be run like example below: <br>

`Visual Studio:` <br>
`flatpak search visualstudio` <br>
`flatpak install com.visualstudio.code` <br>
`flatpak run --command=sh com.visualstudio.code` <br>
`/app/bin/code --no-sandbox  2>/dev/null` <br>
<br>
`Brave browser:` <br>
`flatpak search Brave` <br>
`flatpak install com.brave.Browser` <br>
`flatpak run --command=sh com.brave.Browser` <br>
`/app/brave/brave --no-sandbox --no-zygote --disable-gpu-sandbox --disable-features=UsePortal &` <br>
`Various Options:` <br>
`--no-sandbox --no-zygote --disable-gpu-sandbox --disable-features=UsePortal` <br>


Use ls /app/bin to help find the app in these situations.

<br>

- Apps and their data are saved in ~/opt/bin, ~/.local/share/flatpak, and Aurora + Flatpak are stored in~/opt/.
- --user argument is built-in for this Flatpak since we lack root access.
- Some apps will not run the conventional way. Brave or Visual Studio are good examples.<br>
- Both Brave and Visual Studio run significantly easier without Flatpak by downloading them straight from their websites!

When running VS:
  
`flatpak run --command=sh com.visualstudio.code` <br>
`/app/bin/code --no-sandbox --no-zygote --disable-gpu-sandbox --disable-features=UsePortal` <br> <br>

When running Brave:

`flatpak run --command=sh com.brave.Browser` <br>
`/app/brave/brave --no-sandbox --no-zygote &` <br> <br>

- To find where an app is after opening a shell for the app, run:
`ls /app/bin` <br> <br>


- 4k DPI scaling is easy to apply. Before starting an app run:

`aurora display 2` to set scaling to 2x. <br>
`aurora cursor 32` will set the cursor to 32px. <br>

 Customize to your liking. Applying changes requires restarting app. <br><br>

  #### Sharing files (Similar to "Share with Linux")

 (optional) create a new folder under "MyFiles" (i.e. Steam_files)
 - Open Crosh (ctrl-alt-t) and type in: <br>
`vmc share borealis [folder path from MyFiles]` <br>
- in my example this would be:  <br>
  `vmc share borealis Steam_files` <br>
- if you simply want to share the whole downloads folder do: <br>
  `vmc share borealis Downloads` <br>

 ### How it works:

- Borealis offers hardware acceleration support that makes Crostini's poor performance untenable. 
- Downloads Flatpak and its required dependencies from Arch's repository.
- Extracts Flatpak to ~/opt/flatpak and its dependencies to ~/opt/flatpak-deps
- Adds .bashrc for flatpak commands to actually work.
